        # Explanation of dataset
        The dataset can be broken down into three main components.
                    
        There's the client attributes. These are the standard information the bank would have, presuming that we're calling our existing customer base, and not cold-calling for new customers.
        It's mainly categorical features, with age and balance being numerical.
        There are some categorical values that are almost bolean with nan/unknow values.
        
        Then we have our contact attributes. These are features regarding how a customer was contacted, on what day and which month, and for how long the contact was.
        We checked the dataset, and found that the collection had found place from may 2008 to november 2010. Quickly we realized that this suggest the data has some temporal features to it. As we can see we have the month and the day of month as variables. We know from the dataset that it started may 2008, and is in descending order,
        so the year is implicitly in the data, with the first grouping of may belonging to 2008, the next to 2009 etc. for every month. From that we can build a datetime variable.           

                    
        Lastly there's campaign attributes. There's been a previous campaign (later we will see, some sample imbalance because of this) and the campaign feature captures the number of contacts during the campaign. Pdays is the number of days since the customer was last contacted, previous the number of times, and poutcome the outcome of the previous campaign.
        
        Importantly, the pdays is -1 if the customer has not been contacted before, meaning that a -1 in this feature is different from any other value, and we will later engineer a feature to capture this.

        as mentioned earlier, we created a datetime variable from the day, month and year (inferred from the order of the data).
